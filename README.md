## Overview

in this application i have created a SQL database that my server connects to in order to store and retrieve location and weather information for requested city. 

## Getting Started
in order to create this app on your own machine and to get it running you'll need to create a database on your local machine and obtain an API keys to access info from internet. 

## Architecture
In making of this application I used javaScript, schema.sql and .env files to write my codes in and store my api keys to access and generate my code on the browser. I have also used .json files to store and access all my dependencies. A README.md to describe my application steps in the making. 

## Change Log
01-13-21 @2:00pm  - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource.
